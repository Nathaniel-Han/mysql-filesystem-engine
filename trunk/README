WARNING!  This code is VERY preliminary.  It is certainly unsafe.  Please
do not use in production.  If it breaks, you keep both parts.

Based on the very helpful skeleton example plugin from Brian Aker.


To install, grab a copy of the mysql source code and run this:
sh config/bootstrap
./configure --with-mysql=/home/brian/mysql-5.1/ --libdir=/usr/local/lib/mysql/
make install

And then inside of MySQL:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN filesystem SONAME 'libfilesystem_engine.so';

mysql> CREATE TABLE `d` (`a` varchar(125), b text, primary key(a)) ENGINE=filesystem CONNECTION="/proc/loadavg";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

This is currently supported only on linux (patches welcome!)
